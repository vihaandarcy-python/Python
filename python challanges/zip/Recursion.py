# Part 1: What Is Recursion?
# Like Inception: a dream inside a dream inside a dream
# A recursive function calls a smaller version of itself.
# Two rules:  (1) call with a SMALLER problem each time
#             (2) always have a BASE CASE to stop

print("=== Dream Recursion Lab ===")
print("two rules of recursion:")
print("(1) call with a SMALLER problem each time")
print("(2) always have a BASE CASE to stop")
print()

# PART 2: Count 1 to 10 -- recursion going up
# Base case: n>10, stop.
# Recursive case: print n, then call with n + 1

def count_up(n):
    if n > 10:                # base case
        return
    print(n, end=" ")
    count_up(n + 1)   #recursive call - n grows towards base case

print("Counting 1 to 10 using recursion:")
count_up(1)
print()

# Part 3: Countdown -- shows recursion BUILDING down then UNWINDS back up
#count_down(5) calls count_down(4), which calls count_down(3)....
# Each call WAITS. when base case hits, results bubble back up.

def countdown(n):
    if n == 0:                    # base case
        print('Liftoff!!')
        return
    print(n, end=" ")
    countdown(n - 1)   # recursive call: n shrinks toward 0

print("Countdown (builds down, unwinds up):")
countdown(5)
print()

# PART 4: LFactorial -- recursion that multiplies on the way back up
# Factorial (5) * factorial(4) = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
#Base vase: n == 0 or n == 1, return 1
# Recursive case: n * factorial(n - 1)

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:            # base case
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)     # recursive call: n shrinks

print("Factorial using recursion:")
print("factorial(5) =", factorial(5))
print("factorial(4) =", factorial(4))
print("factorial(1) =", factorial(1))
print("factorial(0) =", factorial(0))

# PART 5: Stack overflow -- what happens with NO base case
# Python allows a maximum of 1000 recursive calls (default limit)
# Without a base case, calls never stop -- RecursionError: stack overflow!
